ArianaGrande.csv,Ariana Grande,Open Letter to Fans,,2014-07-14,so the news is out about sam  cat i felt it wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever,2014
